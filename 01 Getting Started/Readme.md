# 🚀 Node.js Learning Journey

## 📌 Getting Started with Node.js

### 1️⃣ What is Node.js?
- 🌍 **Open-source & Cross-platform** runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside the browser.
- ⚡ **Ideal for backend services** and building APIs.
- 🔄 **Asynchronous & Non-blocking** architecture makes it highly scalable.
- 🏗️ **Great for prototyping & agile development.**
- 🏢 Used by major companies like **PayPal, Netflix, and LinkedIn**.
- 📚 Has a **large ecosystem** with open-source libraries.

### 2️⃣ Node Architecture
- 🏃 **Runtime Environment:** Runs JavaScript outside the browser.
- 💡 Before Node.js, JavaScript was only used inside browsers.
- 🔥 **Powered by Google's V8 engine** (used in Chrome).
- 🏗️ Created by **Ryan Dahl** in **2009**.
- ❌ **Not a programming language or framework**, just a runtime environment.

### 3️⃣ How Node.js Works?
- 🔄 **Event-driven & Non-blocking architecture** for high scalability.
- ⚙️ Uses a **single-threaded event loop** to handle multiple requests.
- 📥 Incoming requests go into an **event queue**.
- 🚀 **Best for I/O-heavy applications, not CPU-intensive tasks.**

### 4️⃣ Installing Node.js
- ✅ Check if Node is installed: `node --version`
- 🌐 Download from: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org)
- 🛠️ Follow the installation guide in the documentation.

### 5️⃣ Your First Node.js Program
- 📂 Create a directory and add a file `app.js`.
- ✍️ Write the following code:

```javascript
function sayHello(name){
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}
sayHello("Sambhav");
```
- ▶️ Run the file using: `node app.js`
- 🚫 No `window` object in Node.js (unlike browsers)!
